# GK1H-T1.21.1Fa 1.3.0 - Fuzs Mod Additions & Server-Sided + Unused Mod Removals

## Mod Additions

Pixelshot

## Mod Replacements

Mob Plaques --> Health Bars

## **WARNINGS!!!**

Fast Item Frames removal will break all item frames in your worlds, **PLEASE EITHER DESTROY ANY ITEMS FRAMES PRIOR TO INSTALLING THIS VERSION OR INSTALL IT AND REINSTALL FAST ITEM FRAMES BEFORE ENTERING A WORLD!!!**

**THIS UPDATE REMOVES SOME SERVER-ONLY OPTIMIZATION MODS, IF YOU USE THIS MODPACK FOR WORLDS YOU MUST READD THEM MANUALLY!!!** I also recommend you readd all mods not marked with unused or a special reason, **BUT DO ADD MODS MARKED AS LIBRARY WITH REMOVED DEPENDENT(S) THAT YOU READD!!!**

## Notices

This modpack was never intended for server-sided use in the first place, but this update onwards server-sided use is now not supported, and also for client on Fabric/Forge/NeoForge servers with gameplay-changing mods that are required on client. This is only for vanilla or plugin software servers.

Just Enough Items was removed from GK1H-T1.21.1NF, but that modpack is intended for servers with the same modpack, making it unnecessary. Since some servers might use JEI, it is included in this one since EMI has compatibility with it installed.
