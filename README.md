GK1H Optimization & Quality Of Life is a Vanilla+ modpack made by Gameking1happy Development. It is forked from GK1H Vanilla+ 0.9.2, which was created by Gameking1happy using the instance he used for vanilla, with additions including stuff to actually make it into a modpack. It then was rebuilt using NeoForge 1.21.1, being release the version after 0.9.2, and is now only for use in singleplayer or servers using the modpack. GK1HOQOL is intended to be mostly vanilla, consisting of mostly optimization and QOL additions and changes, and any other additions or changes are minor.
